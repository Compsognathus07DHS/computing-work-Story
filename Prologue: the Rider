  Looking at his watch, Rider shook his head. "Where's that stupid girl? I hope she didn't get into trouble again," He thought. He sat on his bike and rode to the GPS coordinates of
Arachnid's phone's location.
  
  Meanwhile, in Alley 13. 
  
  A girl with black glasses was gripping her yellow wallet so tightly until her knuckles turned white. (her wallet IS yellow right) Groaning, she bashed it against the wall next to her as if she was squashing a scuttling cockroach into a jam. Suddenly, it unfolded and a few notes popped out and landed on the dirty floor. She then flipped the card compartment out and fiddled with it until it became a fan shaped set of blades - her cards were actually thin metal knives. She then spun around to face the mysterious person following her, ready to use her blade fan. 
  
  A loud revving of a motor bike engine announced Rider's glorious arrival. He jumped off his bike with an ungraceful thud and immediately rushed off to pick up Arachnid.
