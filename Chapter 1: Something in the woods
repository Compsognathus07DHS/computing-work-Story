  The helicopter flew over the clearing of the forest. The Vigilante, Urban, Casino and Arachnid jumped off, whereas the Rider was already there, bike still on fire. "Sup slowpokes,"
Rider taunted. Urban rolled her eyes. "I swear, u say that again and I'll use a fire extinguisher" she said. "Babe don't be mean." the Vigilante muttered.
  The search begun. "That bald guy said that the dude looked like a hermit without a face. let's look for that." Casino suggested. "This forest is So BiG. Split up lah, easier lai
dat." Arachnid added. Vigilante and Urban went to the North, Rider and Casino went South, and Arachnid and a few soldiers went West.

In the South:
  Rider and Casino saw no sign of a "hermit without a face", so they decided to rest and play poker under a tree. "Ummmm, dude, look up." Rider stuttered. Above them, various decapitated
bodies were found. Casino levitated up. He instantly recognised one of the bodies. "Hey, that dude Shaw is up here!" Casino shouted.

In the West:
  A rather scenic walk it was, but no creepy stuff, just a beautiful lake. They decided to rest by the lake and have a snack. A group of locals, sunburnt and malnourished, limped over.
"Help! Our boss's been murdered!" one shouted.

In the North:
  Vigilante and Urban did not have to walk long to find the Guardian. "I've been warned...of 5 heroes...You 2 must be part...Now tell me...your greatest fear.." he said. "This is not good." Urban thought. A mist surrounded
them. 
  Urban was transported to a road. Fire surrounded her. People were shouting "Asian Lives Matter". A car beside her exploded. It all seemed so... familiar. Then it hit her: It was the 
day she saw her brother get killed in
