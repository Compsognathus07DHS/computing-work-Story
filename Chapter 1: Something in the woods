  The helicopter flew over the clearing of the forest. The Vigilante, Urban, Casino and Arachnid jumped off, whereas the Rider was already there, bike still on fire. "Sup slowpokes,"
Rider taunted. Urban rolled her eyes. "I swear, u say that again and I'll use a fire extinguisher" she said. "Babe don't be mean." the Vigilante muttered.
  The search begun. "That bald guy said that the dude looked like a hermit without a face. let's look for that." Casino suggested. "This forest is So BiG. Split up lah, easier lai
dat." Arachnid added. Vigilante and Urban went to the North, Rider and Casino went South, and Arachnid and a few soldiers went West.

In the South:
  Rider and Casino saw no sign of a "hermit without a face", so they decided to rest and play poker under a tree.
