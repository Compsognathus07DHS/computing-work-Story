  Night.
  Gunshots filled the usually quiet neighbourhood of Famino. Two burly men in masks, firing aimlessly at an enemy they know they can't defeat. "He's closing on us Mack!" the first 
man, Luis, said. "I know!" Mack screamed. Their backs hit the dead end of the alley. A red light flashes.
  Darkness.
  He comes closer.
  Blinks again.
  Closer.
  Blinks.
  Blade raised.
  Their screams pierced through the night sky. Birds flew away in fear. [insert hero 1's name] wipes off the blood on his blade. "Another stain. I gotta wash these off someday." 
[insert hero 1's name] muttered. His watch rang. "Calling all heros in the vicinity, we need your help", the audio played. Shrugging, [insert hero 1's name] walked away from the 2
headless bodies  in the alley.
